BEFORE YOU START:
You can either use Demo Mode or your own Frostr group credentials (bfshare + bfgroup) from another Frostr app like Igloo Desktop or Igloo CLI. This app cannot create new groups.

SETUP:
Option A - Demo Mode (recommended for review):
1. Open the app -> "Get Started" -> "How Igloo Works"
2. Tap "Enter Demo Mode"
3. Tap "Save Credentials" to load the demo group/share and continue

Option B - Your Credentials:
1. Open the app and tap "Scan QR Code" or "Enter Manually"
2. Import your share and group credentials
3. Start the signer and select a soundscape

PLEASE TEST:
• Background reliability - Does the signer stay connected when you switch apps or lock your phone?
• Signing requests - Initiate a signature from another device in your group. Does Igloo respond?
• Peer status - Are your group peers showing online/offline correctly?
• Soundscape playback - Do the ambient sounds play smoothly? Any audio glitches?
• Phone calls/interruptions - Does the app resume properly after a call?

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
• Cannot initiate signatures (respond only)
• Requires another Frostr app to generate credentials

FEEDBACK WELCOME:
• Battery usage concerns
• Any crashes or freezes
• Suggestions for additional soundscapes
• UI/UX improvements
