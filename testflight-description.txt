Igloo IOS is a mobile signer for Frostr, a threshold signing protocol built on nostr. It allows your iPhone to participate in distributed key signing groups, helping secure your nostr identity across multiple devices.

The app features ambient soundscapes that play while your signer is active - choose from calming environments like ocean waves, rainfall, or forest sounds. These soundscapes provide an audible indicator that your signer is running and create a relaxing atmosphere while Igloo works in the background responding to signing requests from your group.

Key Features:
• Run a Frostr signer node on your iPhone
• Respond to threshold signing requests from group members
• Monitor peer status and connection health
• Ambient soundscapes with multiple environments to choose from
• Adjustable volume controls

Igloo IOS works alongside other Frostr-compatible apps like Igloo Desktop, Igloo CLI, or Igloo Server and requires existing group credentials to operate.
